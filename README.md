# todo-list
A to-do list app that runs as script, plus another version that's been packed into an EXE file for easier use.


If you're interested upgrading this app for personal use or making a similar one, but aren't familiar with the packages used,
go to my 'reading-list-database' repository. It was used as a template for this app, so it's a more detailed and better commented
version of similar code.
